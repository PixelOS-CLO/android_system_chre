/**
 * @file
 * This file defines the API for CHRE data flows, which are designed for
 * efficient high-throughput data transmission between a single source
 * and multiple sinks, which may include nanoapps and other endpoints. These
 * data flows enable the transfer of large amounts of data with minimal data
 * copies, leveraging shared memory regions. Data flows are uinquely identified
 * by the message hub ID of the source and the data flow ID. They provide a
 * mechanism for nanoapps to exchange data streams, supporting various new data
 * alert and overwrite policies to suit different batching use cases.
 *
 * Here is an example of a source nanoapp that creates a data flow and adds a
 * sink nanoapp:
 *
 * - Source nanoapp:
 *  - Creates a data flow and receives the CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_CREATED event
 *
 * - Sink nanoapp:
 *  - Uses endpoint messaging to request a sink be created on the data flow for
 *    the sink nanoapp.
 *
 * - Source nanoapp:
 *  - Responds to the request and creates a sink
 *  - The sink handle is sent to the sink nanoapp by the platform.
 *  - Receives the CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_SINK_CONFIGURE_DONE event, indicating
 *    the sink was successfully created and notified
 *
 * - Sink nanoapp:
 *  - Receives the CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_SINK_CREATED event
 *  - Calls chreDataFlowSinkEnable() to enable the sink
 *
 * - Source nanoapp:
 *  - Pushes data into the data flow
 *  - May receive a CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_ALERT event, indicating an underlying
 *    change in the data flow, i.e. that the source can push more data.
 *
 * - Sink nanoapp:
 *  - Receives the CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_ALERT event, indicating data is
 *    available (only if never notify was NOT selected) or an underlying change
 *    in the underlying data flow
 *  - Alternatively may at any time use the sink API to poll the data flow
 *  - Processes the data and releases the elements
 *
 * - Either nanoapp:
 *  - Can disable the sink
 *  - Both nanoaps receive a CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_SINK_STOPPED event, indicating
 *    a state change in the underlying data flow (sink is gone)
 *
 * - Source nanoapp:
 *  - Destroys the data flow explicitly or on unload
 *
 * - Source nanoapp:
 *  - If it crashes, the sink nanoapp will receive a
 *    CHRE_EVENT_DATA_FLOW_STOPPED event.

/**
 * Creates a data flow with the given properties. This data flow will be used

 *
 * The data flow may be instantiated in a new or existing region, guaranteed
 * to have the provided domain and permission properties. The parameters
 * sinkDomains, minAverageWriteIntervalNs, and
 * maxAverageWriteBandwidthBytesPerSecond are used to guide the platform on
 * memory bank selection. Once a data flow is created, its memory region cannot
 * be changed without destroying and re-creating the flow, so nanoapps should
 * supply values that represent the desired performance and power attributes for
 * the lifetime of the flow.
 *
 * @param sinkDomains A bitmask of CHRE_DATA_FLOW_SINK_DOMAIN_* values,
 *     indicating the sink domains that this data flow must be able to support.
 * @param minAverageWriteIntervalNs The expected minimum average (sustained)
 *     interval between successive writes to the data flow, in nanoseconds.
 *     This guides the platform towards selecting a memory region with suitable
 *     power attributes.
 * @param maxAverageWriteBandwidthBytesPerSecond The expected maximum average
 *     (sustained) write bandwidth for the data flow, in bytes per second. This
 *     guides the platform towards selecting and/or configuring a memory region
 *     with suitable performance attributes.
 * @param sinkPermissions Bitmask of permissions that must be held to receive
 *     data from the data flow, and will be attributed to the recipient.
 *     Primarily relevant when the destination endpoint is an Android
 *     application. Refer to CHRE_MESSAGE_PERMISSION_* values. Both the source
 *     and sink nanoapps must have these permissions.
 * @param elementSize The size of each element in bytes. If
 *     CHRE_DATA_FLOW_ELEMENT_SIZE_VARIABLE, the data flow will have variable
 *     size elements.
 * @param alignment The alignment of each element in bytes. If
 *     CHRE_DATA_FLOW_ELEMENT_ALIGNMENT_UNALIGNED, the data flow will have no
 *     alignment requirements and elements will be packed, with no padding
 *     inserted to ensure alignment. In this case, special care must be taken on

 *     data flow. If this amount cannot be allocated, this function will return
 *     CHRE_STATUS_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
 * @param maxElementCount The maximum number of elements to allocate for the
 *     data flow. Must be greater than or equal to minElementCount. The data
 *     flow will dynamically grow up to this size as needed. If this is
 *     CHRE_DATA_FLOW_DYNAMIC_MAX_SIZE, then the data flow will be created with
 *     a maximum size determined by CHRE. Note that the data flow may not be
 *     able to grow to this max size if other data flows in the same region grow
 *     to their maximum sizes and the region cannot accommodate more elements.
